This repository contains programs I wrote for Jeff Feder's lab at the
University of Notre Dame during the summer of 2017.

Most of these programs help merge Entropy and Clumpak, which I have included
here (with very slight modifications to each).

Other programs are designed for use with Lep-MAP3, which can be downloaded from
sourceforge.
